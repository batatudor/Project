        "description": "-volume edition of Tolkien's classic masterpiece that is fully illustrated in watercolour throughout by the acclaimed and award-winning artist, Alan Lee. Since it was first published in 1954, The Lord of the Rings has been a book people have treasured. Steeped in unrivalled magic and otherworldliness, its sweeping fantasy has touched the hearts of young and old alike. Well over 100 million copies of its many editions have been sold around the world, and occasional collectors' editions become prized and valuable items of publishing. With the epic trilogy now an acclaimed, award-winning and billion-dollar success, images of the characters and landscapes have become iconic to a whole new generation of readers. Much of the look of these movies is based on Alan Lee's paintings, giving this sumptuous new edition of Tolkien's great work new relevance for the ever-growing number of fans.",

With this hands-on guide, you’ll learn how to build applications that target iOS, Android, and other mobile platforms instead of browsers. You’ll also discover how to access platform features such as the camera, user location, and local storage. With code examples and step-by-step instructions, author Bonnie Eisenman shows web developers and frontend engineers how to build and style interfaces, use mobile components, and debug and deploy apps. Along the way, you’ll build several increasingly sophisticated sample apps with React Native before putting everything together at the end. Learn how React Native provides an interface to native UI components Examine how the framework uses native components analogous to HTML elements Create and style your own React Native components and applications Install modules for APIs and features not supported by the framework Get tools for debugging your code, and for handling issues outside of JavaScript Put it all together with the Zebreto effective-memorization flashcard app Deploy apps to the iOS App Store and Google’s Play Store",
